						<p>My name is Joshua Newton.  This is my third year at Kennesaw State University, working on my BBA in Information Systems.  I was born and raised in Georgia, living in several communities ranging from Macon to Lilburn.</p>  
						<p>I served five years in the United States Marine Corps, during which time I held billets in Seattle, Washington, Camp Lejeune, North Carolina, and Al Asad, Iraq.  My primary duty was that of a rifleman, but I also served as a Fireteam Leader, Vehicle Commander, and Supervisor of a Back-up security force.  During this time, I was exposed to several technologies which have led to my interest in Information Systems, especially those involving security, and location sharing.</p>
						<p>I currently work as a Technical Support representative at CMI, a marketing research company here in Atlanta. While helping users with their computer issues, I often find places where an in house application can help stream line menial processes, and give users a better overall experience.</p>
